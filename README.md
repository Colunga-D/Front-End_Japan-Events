# Japan Events Project

This project is an events page in Japan, featuring various events across the country. Users can choose which events to participate in based on their date, event capacity, and location.

The page includes a login system where users can identify themselves as either regular users or administrators. Administrators have exclusive sections for adding, deleting, and editing events, while regular users can only sign up or withdraw from an event. Upon signing up for an event, users receive a confirmation email to stay informed about the event date.

For this project, we used Vue 3 as the foundation for our frontend, along with JavaScript and Sass. The backend is built with Spring Boot and Java, utilizing SQL databases and Docker containers.

The project was developed entirely from scratch by our development team, and the design is also our own creation.
